What is this? 
System Verilog code for a magnet-detecting Maze Solver (left and right affinity choices, accerleratoin, victory music and so on!) - we ran this on an ALtera FPGA. 

This includes files pertaining to design entry and functional testing in Verilog, and synthesis via Synopsys Design Vision. The runner uses a MEMS gryoscope that interacts with IR sensors for navigation, a PID controller to make control-input decisions and serial transmission lines for communication.
